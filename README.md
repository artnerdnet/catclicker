# CAT CLICKER
Learning MVC through a Cat Clicker with Udacity. You will find in the /js folder three subfolders that contain the Model, the View and the Octopus (Controller).

## MVC
The model contains the data (names, images src, number of clicks); the Octopus (controller) receives events and controls the View or Model giving them commands; the View is the responsible for the interface using the data from the model that is passed by the Octopus (controller).

## About the Cat Clicker

There are 4 cats with their names. When clicking on their names the cat will appear and you can click it as many times as you want. If you switch from one cat to the other, the amount of clicks is still there and you can resume clicking your favorite cat.

*Fun fact:* Cats are named after the movie directors [Orson Welles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orson_Welles), [Quentin Tarantino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quentin_Tarantino), [Jean Cocteau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Cocteau) and [Alfred Hitchcock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Hitchcock).
